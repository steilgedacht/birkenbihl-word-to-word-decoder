# Birkenbihl Method Word-to-Word-decoder

This is a software that translates a text word by word like it is needed in the Birkenbihl language learning method.
The software is made with Visual Studio, the project files are in /Bergmann_Dekodierer

## Usage

### Vocabulary List
Just download the Bergmann_Dekodierer.exe and the Vokabelliste Folder.
In the Vokabelliste you find a Textdocument, that consists of the words and the corresponding translation in the next line below.
You can simply modify this file and add new vocabulary.

After starting the software you can insert your text in the first Textbox:

If you want to find out which words are missing in your vocabulary list, then you can enter the "missing words mode".
Here each word that is not found in the list is printed in the box below for you to translate and add to the list.
In the right box you then see the hole translated text.
